Cafe Chronicles - Design Justification 


About Cafe Chronicles & Backstory: 
Inspired by our shared love for cafes and riddles (hence why we are computer science majors, as programming is just one giant riddle), we decided to blend storytelling and exploration to create a cafe adventure game. The game features a barista as the player, a customer, a manager, and riddles. The player must venture off to find the ingredients to make the drink that is ordered. Along the way, the player may encounter the Cafe's manager, Berta. Berta will propose a riddle, and if the player guesses the correct answer, Berta will give the player a hint to find the ingredients. If not, no hint will be given. Upon finding the ingredients, the player must make their way back to the Cafe in order to create the drink and give it to the customer. If they encounter Berta again, she will give the player hints on where to go. Once the player makes it back to the Cafe, the game will be complete, and the player wins! The player can choose to quit, ask for help, or drop their inventory at any point in the game. Overall, we wanted to create a fun yet challenging game that involved critical thinking and problem-solving.


Mechanics of Game: 
We decided to include riddles in order to make the game more engaging and to test the player's problem-solving skills. To enhance gameplay, NPCs were used to provide challenges and assistance. In addition, we decided to utilize a 2D array instead of the other option mentioned in class, as we found it to align more with our goals. It was also less difficult for us when it came to keeping track of player movement and room locations. The use of different settings such as a cove and valley were meant to help the player better immerse themself into the game.


Alternative: 
One alternative we considered for this project was a grocery shopping game. The player would be given a list of food and household items, and they would have to shop for the correct items in a timely manner. Similar to Cafe Chronicles, this would have involved the use of a 2D array and NPCs. However, we decided to opt for a cafe and riddles game, as it seemed more engaging.
