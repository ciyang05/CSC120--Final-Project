 Chiashi Yang: 
 My overall approach to tackling this project was to manage my time and ask for help. I wanted to make sure that I gave myself enough time to code my classes instead of scrambling to finish everything. In addition, I made sure to ask for help whenever I was confused about how to approach something. Something new I learned while completing this project was how to use and implement 2D arrays. Because I was in charge of the map, I had to experiment with different methods and figure out ways to connect the player to the map. I definitely had to do a lot of trial and error but eventually figured it out. I do wish that I had implemented the barista class differently, specifically with just having cleaner code. Additionally, I wish we would have spread out the ingredients throughout the map instead of just having all the ingredients for a drink in one spot. If I had unlimited time, I would implement more riddles and add more NPCs. The most helpful feedback I received while working on this project was about my move method. I was having a lot of trouble with the logic and how to implement it, so my sister gave me some feedback. If I could give my past self some hints, I would say "You'll need a lot more methods than you think, and don't stress too much about the project. Everything will come together." I worked in a 3-person team to complete this project. Our team dynamics were very well balanced. We all worked together whenever an issue occurred and split up our work evenly. I really enjoyed my experience with my group members. We had lots of fun but still completed everything in a timely manner.
